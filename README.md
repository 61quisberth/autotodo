# Autotodo

### Why maintain your own TODO files?
Keeping documentation up to date is tough, non-source files such as a TODO file will not break code if it is left stale, which is why generally these files are the last to be updated.

Keeping an up to date TODO file allows users to be kept up to date with tasks yet to be done, without relying on third party issue tracking software.

### Why not generate TODO tasks with simple source code comments?
Autotodo is a C++ source code parser that extracts TODO source code lines and outputs
a TODO file with surrounding source code pointing to source of undone tasks
